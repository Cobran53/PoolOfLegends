# PoolOfLegends
Here's a tool to find your pool of champions! All data is from U.GG, if they ask I will remove this.

Launch the PoolOfLegends.exe in the .zip, and you're good to go!

How this works is a small web server is launched on your PC, allowing you to visit the website by yourself. When you click on Evaluate, it will look up URLs from u.gg, and compile the information into a nice table!
